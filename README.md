# Amazon Rating Product & Sorting Reviews
![amazon-reu-1785074](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/111612847/225811026-a9d5b402-b490-4365-abcf-677425f0bc24.jpg)

# Business Problem

One of the most important problems in e-commerce is the accurate calculation of post-purchase ratings given to products.
Solving this problem means providing more customer satisfaction for e-commerce sites, highlighting the product for sellers, and
ensuring a seamless shopping experience for buyers. Another problem is the correct sorting of product reviews. Misleading reviews
standing out can directly affect the sale of the product, causing both financial loss and customer loss. Solving these two main
problems will increase sales for e-commerce sites and sellers, while customers will complete their purchase journey seamlessly.
